title: Manifesto
---

There are many people who are trying to bring Brussels to the 21st century. People who are trying to redefine mobility, education, environment, art, culture, etc.

We need to support them. They need visibility, but they also need human, material and financial resources.

Today, they mostly rely on very old and inefficient systems to get funding through subsidies. It's a distraction and it's not sustainable. There's got to be a better way.

That's what we want to explore with #BrusselsTogether. Can we recreate a city from the bottom up, with transparency, inclusiveness, and an experimentation spirit as its core? A city where everyone is invited to contribute? 
*A city where everything is possible*.

We are starting by creating this open collective to gather everyone who wants to contribute to make Brussels a great city to live and work.

Contribute to the movement by supporting any initiative listed on [our collective page](https://opencollective.com/BrusselsTogether). You can support them by attenting their events and/or by helping them cover their costs.

You can also support our own collective by [making a donation](https://opencollective.com/BrusselsTogether#support) or by [becoming a member for â‚¬10/month](https://opencollective.com/BrusselsTogether/donate/10/monthly).

To drive our attention to any cool initiative happening in Brussels, simply share it with the #BrusselsTogether hashtag.

We are also crowdsourcing in this [open spreadsheet](http://bit.ly/BrusselsTogetherSpreadsheet) places in Brussels that can be used by those projects to meet and work. We are also listing there people who don't have a project but would love to contribute one way or another. Fill it up!

Be part of the change. 

We all have something to contribute.
