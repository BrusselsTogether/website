title: Manifesto
---

There are many people who are trying to bring Brussels to the 21st century. People who are trying to redefine mobility, education, environment, art, culture, etc.

We need to support them. They need visibility, but they also need human, material and financial resources.

Today, they mostly rely on very old and inefficient systems to get funding through subsidies. It's a distraction and it's not sustainable. There's got to be a better way.

That's what we want to explore with #BrusselsTogether. Can we recreate a city from the bottom up, with transparency, inclusiveness, and an experimentation spirit as its core? A city where everyone is invited to contribute? 
*A city where everything is possible*.

We are starting by creating this open collective to gather everyone who wants to contribute to make Brussels a great city to live and work.

Contribute by sharing the great initiatives that are happening in Brussels with the #BrusselsTogether hashtag, or directly add your project or yourself as a potential volunteer on our [open spreadsheet](http://bit.ly/BrusselsTogetherSpreadsheet). We are also crowdsourcing in this spreadsheet places in Brussels that can be used by those projects to meet and work.

Be part of the change. 

We all have something to contribute.

# Our Values

## Inclusive

We are inviting everyone who spends time in Brussels and who wants to contribute to this movement. It doesn’t matter if you are a Belgian citizen or not, with or without work permit, what the color of your skin is. You have a talent and you should be able to express it. We will all benefit from it. Your contribution is not only welcome, it is needed. If you have a project, if you want to organize an activity in Brussels, the default answer should be yes, let’s do it. And we will help you do it.

## Positive and surreal

Brussels has always been the city of the surrealism. Let’s embrace what makes us unique. Like we did with the cats during the surreal #BrusselsLockdown ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AB6K7rWlG4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AB6K7rWlG4)) . Let’s show the world a new way to deal with the challenges of our time.

## Constructive

We don’t have time to complain. We don’t have time to tell people what they should be doing or not. We only have time to support constructive initiatives, lead by people who are full of positive energy and who want to do their part.

## Experimental spirit

It’s OK to fail. We are here to learn, together. Over time we will get better at identifying and supporting the projects the right way. In the meantime, everybody is invited to experiment, own their successes and failures, share them and contribute to the community’s learning process.

## Every little contribution matters

Like the hummingbird trying to extinguish the fire in the forest, we believe that we should all do our part. Every contribution is valuable. Every initiative, large or small, is important.

## Apolitical

We are not a political party. We are not here to debate. We are here to get things done. We don’t care which political party you are supporting. As long as you share the values of the movement, you are welcome.

We can make Brussels the best, most vibrant and inclusive city of the world. 

Join the movement. Submit projects. Experiment. Contribute. And spread the word.
