We are citizens who have a love and hate relationship with Brussels and who want to do something about it.

**Hate** because Brussels is a mess. It's been like that forever. And for some reason this city is still stuck in the 20th century.

**Love** because Brussels has so much potential. It's such a diverse city with more than 163 nationalities, it's the capital of more than 500 millions Europeans. There is so much talent in this city, if only we can unlock it.

So let's focus our attention and our energy on what we can do.

## Don't reinvent the wheel, collaborate
Brussels is full of talents. There are already plenty of people doing great projects. The problem is that we are all operating in silo and as a result, we each keep on reinventing the wheel again and again.
So we don't want to create yet another initiative. We want to help others and federate them. How?

## Radical inclusiveness
BrusselsTogether belongs to all of us who care about Brussels. You don't need to ask for permission. It's a movement. As long as you are willing to contribute to make Brussels a great city to live and work for everybody, you are BrusselsTogether.
