## Who are you?

We are simple citizens who want to do their part to make Brussels a great city to live, to work, to have fun for everyone.

## What's your goal?

Our goal is to make it easy for everyone to play their part to make Brussels a great city to live and work.

A city that is inclusive, open and always positive. A city that is safe, where living and working feels good, where people can easily meet and easily go from point A to point B, where there are always plenty of activities for everyone. Where everyone can feel at home. This is our best chance to win against extremism, radicalism and immobilism. This is our best chance to make Brussels a great city where we want to work and live.

## What are your areas of focus?

While we are very open, we are particularly interested in initiatives that aim at improving mobility, education and inclusiveness in Brussels.

## What do you actually do?

We have created a non profit (ASBL/VZW) in Brussels so that other citizen initiatives don't have to. Our goal is to mutualise accounting, legal, and other services that are common to all citizen led initiatives in Brussels (see [our statuses](https://data.be/fr/societe/Brusselstogether-ASBL-0664932030)).

We are also sometimes organizing our own events, writing blog posts and [making videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOsxUOEKArKmQ47f2KxFfXQ) with always the same goal: put the spotlight on all the citizen initiatives happening in our city.

## How to contribute?

The best way to contribute is to start your own initiative! [apply](https://opencollective.com/brussels/apply).

We also need volunteers for our own collective!
People who can organize meetups, write blog posts, manage our social media, etc.
If that sounds like you, join our Slack and introduce yourself! https://slack.brusselstogether.org.

You can also support BrusselsTogether financially by [making a donation](https://opencollective.com/BrusselsTogether/donate) or by [becoming a member for €10/month](https://opencollective.com/brusselstogether/order/120).
We also invite you to directly contribute to the collective of a project that you like and that is listed on our [collective page](https://opencollective.com/brusselstogether#members). If they are on that page, then they all share the same values and same level of transparency on how they will use the funds that they raise.

## How to add an initiative

Apply to create a collective for your initiative. You will be automatically listed as part of the network and get more opportunities to collect donations to sustain your activities. <a href="/services/">Find out more</a> - <a href="https://opencollective.com/brussels/apply">Apply</a></li>

## What is an open collective?

Think of an open collective as a non profit association for the 21st century. One that you can create online without any paperwork and that is fully transparent. It's a place where you can collect one time and recurring donations (monthly or yearly) and where anyone in the community can file expenses for reimbursement. After approval by the administrators of the collective, the host (in this case #Open Collective Brussels ASBL) reimburses the expenses. No more paperwork, passing around a credit card, running behind receipts and bookkeeping! You can also create events and sell tickets and sponsorships.

Check out these examples:

- [VeganBrussels](https://opencollective.com/VeganBrussels)
- [HuNeeds](https://opencollective.com/huneeds)

## How can people give money to a collective?

You can send money to any collective by credit card or by bank transfer.

## How can I get money from the collective?

For transparency, you need to upload a receipt or the invoice to your collective. Then, once approved by one of the administrators of the collective, you will be reimbursed on your paypal account or bank account.

## How much does it cost?

It's free to [create your collective on BrusselsTogether](https://opencollective.com/brussels/apply), create events and file expenses.

There is no fee for donations received by bank transfer (useful for subsidies and other one time grants).

If you want to receive money online (useful for recurring donations), the platform Open Collective charges a 5% fee + credit card fees (1.4% + €0.25 for European cards and 2.9% + €0.25 for non-European cards).

We will split the cost of accounting proportionally to all collectives (right now it's €200/month). The more collectives we have the cheaper it will be for everyone (we have today [13 active collectives](https://opencollective.com/brusselstogether#members).

## What do we do with your money?

We are fully transparent with our own money, see our own [BrusselsTogether Collective](https://opencollective.com/brusselstogether#budget) and anyone is free to [submit an expense to the collective](https://opencollective.com/brusselstogether/expenses/new) for things that will help the entire community.

## What are the limitations?

If your collective is hosted by Open Collective Brussels ASBL, you cannot hire people (except freelancers or via [SMartbe](http://smartbe.be/en/)). Beyond that, your collective acts as your own virtual association.

If you need to, you can become an administrator of the association so that you can sign documents on its behalf.

## What if we already have our own ASBL/VZW?

Nothing prevents you from also creating an open collective on BrusselsTogether to benefit from the network. There is no exclusivity. You can either use Open Collective Brussels ASBL to receive donations on your behalf and manage the accounting, or you can directly receive donations on your own bank account.
