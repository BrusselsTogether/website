## Why?

We are all different, we have all our own aspirations, but we have at least one thing in common : we all look for happiness. 

Everyday, we realize how fragile it can be. From racism to terrorism, from traffic jams to strikes, from health emergencies to unemployment, from gender inequalities to poor child care services, we are growing impatient on the capacity of our governments to improve our well-being.

Most of the time, we are resigned about it. Or cynical. We keep fighting for our personal objectives, while leaving the collective ones to God’s sake. But we have more power than we think we have. We must use it and act where we can have an impact.

That’s why we are starting #BrusselsTogether. A movement to invite everyone to play their part to make Brussels a great city to live and work, together. 

A city that is inclusive, open and always positive. A city that is safe, where living and working feels good, where people can easily meet and easily go from point A to point B, where there are always plenty of activities for everyone. Where everyone can feel at home. This is our best chance to win against extremism, radicalism and immobilism. This is our best chance to make Brussels a great city where we want to work and live. 

## What?

#BrusselsTogether is many things. It's first and foremost a hashtag that anyone can use to share interesting initiatives happening in Brussels.
But it's also an open collective to support all of those initiatives. There are many needs that are common between all of those projects.
We all need places to meet and work, we all need visibility, we all need to find sustainable ways to finance ourselves and we all need to find volunteers. By coming together, we can address those needs in a much more effective way without having to reinvent the wheel again and again.

### What type of initiatives?

While we are very open, we are particularly interested in initiatives that aim at improving mobility, education and inclusiveness in Brussels.

## How?

### Open

We are inviting all existing initiatives and everyone who cares about Brussels and who wants to contribute to this movement. You don't have to be a Belgian citizen, you don't even have to live in Brussels as long as you spend time in Brussels and you care about improving the quality of life in the capital of Europe. Our goal is to be as inclusive as possible, that's why we are doing this in English (33% of the population in Brussels is allophone).

### Crowdfunded 

This collective should be funded by the crowd for the crowd to ensure our integrity. We are open to individuals as well as companies’ support. We don't want to rely on the funding of any public institution.

### Transparent

We will operate in full transparency. All the money going out of this collective will be trackable by anyone. And all the results of our actions will be measured as well.

### Together

We need to work together. This is not a zero sum game. We are not here to compete with anyone. Our goal is simply to connect all the existing (and future) initiatives so that we can help each other.
