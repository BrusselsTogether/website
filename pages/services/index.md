description: Create your ASBL/VZW association online. No paperwork.
---

Our goal is to mutualise the cost of creating and running a non profit in Brussels. 

## Wy?
Like the Internet, a city is a public infrastructure on top of which people are invited to contribute.
Making things happen in Brussels today feels like creating a website in 1990. It requires too much work and not everybody has the time nor energy to do it (remember when we had to set up our own web server to host a website?).

Luckily, over the years, it became easier and easier to publish online. We got there by open sourcing the technologies that we all needed so that we could stop wasting time reinventing the wheel and focus instead on our unique contribution to the world.

That's why our goal is to open source all the things that can be open sourced and mutualise all the things that can be mutualised to reduce the friction that exists to create, maintain and operate an association in Brussels.

## Create your association online

As soon as you need to deal with money, you have to create an association (ASBL/VZW). Let's be honest, this is a pain in the ass.
You need to create statuses (in French or Dutch!) and do the accounting. Plus reports that you need to send every year (or every quarter if you are subject to VAT). So much overhead for just throwing up events or doing some local actions here and there. Not to mention that this is something that each and every single association has to do. So much energy wasted.

That's why, BrusselsTogether allows you to create a virtual association online.

### How does it work?

Instead of creating a new legal entity for every project, we have created a generic one BrusselsTogether ASBL that can act as an umbrella for many other initiatives. Using the platform OpenCollective.com, we can easily keep track of how much money has been raised by each collective and how much they can spend at any time. That way, we can mutualise the bookkeeping cost (while it usually costs upward of a thousand euros per year to do the accounting for a non profit, it doesn't cost 10x that for 10 collectives sharing the same host).

Here is an example of a collective: https://opencollective.com/VeganizerBXL (see the list of [all the collectives hosted by BrusselsTogether](https://opencollective.com/BrusselsTogether#collectives)).

People can donate with their credit card or become a member (or "a friend of the collective") with a monthly or yearly donation.
Companies can also become sponsors. They will automatically receive an invoice.

Anyone can submit an expense or an invoice to the collective. Once approved by one of the administrators (the core contributors of the collective), they get reimbursed via PayPal or by bank transfer.

Everybody can see in full transparency how much money there is in the collective and how it is spent. It gives trust to the community to support your collective.

### How to apply?

We will review it as soon as possible (usually takes a day or two)

### How much does it cost?

TLDR:
- You need to be a member of BrusselsTogether ASBL (€10/month) to start your own collective
- Open Collective charges 5% commission on donations made online + credit card fees (1.9% + €0.25 per transaction) charged by [Stripe](https://stripe.com)
- BrusselsTogether doesn't charge any commission but we will split the cost of accounting proportionally to all collectives. The more collectives we have the cheaper it will be for everyone.

### What else can we mutualise?
While accounting is the first obvious service that every single association needs, there are other services that we could easily mutualise as more and more collective share the same host. For example, we could negotiate better deals for insurances for collectives that want to organise street fairs or other activities that would require an insurance. We will do all these things as opportunities present themselves. One step at a time!
